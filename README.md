## 🌟 Professional Projects by Editorial Phases 🌟

**In my journey as a software developer specialized in document design and automation, the projects I've undertaken can be grouped into several phases. Each phase corresponds to a crucial stage in the document editing and layout workflow. Here they are:**

### PHASE 1: Template Design
- Original Template Creation in Word
- Cloning Template from a model PDF in Word
- Template Creation in XML (DocBook+XSLT)

### PHASE 2: Document Preparation
Preparation and Cleanup. Element Extraction (e.g., Images, Tables, Formulas, Code). Structure Verification. Term Standardization.
- 🛠️ **VBA Document Structure Optimizer**: Standardizes document structure by stylizing unformatted titles, inserting hierarchical bookmarks like 'unit' and 'subunit', and managing list markers and manual list numbering. Status: Ready.

### PHASE 3: Document Formatting
Style Application. Typographical Adjustments.
- 🛠️ **GPT-AHK-VBA Real-Time Formatter**: Automates repetitive formatting tasks for real-time needs. Enables quick VBA macro development for style applications. Designed for ergonomic and rapid workflow. Status: Ready.

### PHASE 4: Word to XML DocBook Conversion (If applicable)
Word-to-XML DocBook Transformations. Custom Tagging.
- 🛠️ **VBA-XSLT Word Style to Tag Converter**: Automates the conversion of Word documents with template-specific styles to XML documents with DocBook tags. Utilizes VBA, Java, and XSLT. Robust and efficient transformations. Status: Ready.
- 🛠️ **XSLT Multi-Format Output Generator**: Automates the conversion of DocBook XML to multiple output formats, including HTML and PDF. Utilizes XSLT, Java, and DocBook. Designed for flexible and efficient multi-format publishing. Status: Ready.

### PHASE 5: Output Design and Format Review
- Review of PDF Converted from Word
- Review of Other Multi-format Outputs (e.g., HTML, EBOOK, Audiobook) (If using XML DocBook)

### PHASE 6: Incorporation of Author's Revisions
Preparation of Amendments (e.g., Images, Text, including long fragments). Amendment Introduction (from PDF comments or location-based text doc).
- 🛠️ **AHK PDF-to-XML Jump & Tag Generator**: Streamlines the transfer of author's comments from PDFs to XML DocBook files. Enables "jump" functionality to go from a phrase near a highlighted comment area in the PDF directly to the corresponding point in the XML file, and one-click complex XML tagging. Simplifies comment application to master files. Status: Ready.
- 🛠️ **Java/AcroJS Comment Integrator**: Automates the inclusion of PDF comments into master files like Word and DocBook. Efficiently handles high-volume corrections. Status: In Development.

### PHASE 7: Post-Conversion Adjustments
- Applicable in cases like PDF to Word conversion (e.g., for translations)

### PHASE 8: Miscellaneous (Logistics, Management)

This list is not exhaustive and serves as a snapshot of the software tools that are either complete or in stages of active development.
