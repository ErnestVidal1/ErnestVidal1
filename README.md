## 🌟 Professional Projects by Editorial Phases 🌟

**In my journey as a software developer specialized in document design and automation, the projects I've undertaken can be grouped into several phases. Each phase corresponds to a crucial stage in the document editing and layout workflow. Here they are:**
<br><br>


***🚀 PHASE 1: Template Design**: Original Template Creation in Word. Cloning Template from a model PDF in Word. Template Creation in XML (DocBook+XSLT)*
<br><br>


***🚀 PHASE 2: Document Preparation**: Preparation and Cleanup. Element Extraction (e.g., Images, Tables, Formulas, Code). Structure Verification. Term Standardization.*
### 🟠 Status In Development. VBA DOCUMENT CLEANER
Automates the cleaning of Word documents by removing excess markers, blank lines, and double spaces. Also standardizes fonts and styles for a cleaner, more unified text.
### 🟢 Status Ready. VBA DOCUMENT ELEMENT EXTRACTOR
Automates the extraction of key elements like images, tables, equations, and source code from Word docs into separate files. Useful for collaboration and generating text-only docs.
### 🟠 Status In Development. VBA ELEMENT OPTIMIZER
Enhances the VBA Document Element Extractor by adding post-extraction features. Includes OCR for images, Word-to-MathML equation conversion, and table styling.
### 🟢 Status Ready. VBA DOCUMENT STRUCTURE OPTIMIZER
Standardizes document structure by stylizing unformatted titles, inserting hierarchical bookmarks like 'unit' and 'subunit', and managing list markers and manual list numbering. 
### 🟠 Status In Development. **VBA TERM STANDARDIZER**
Automatically standardizes terminology across the document. For instance, it replaces "chapter" with "module" or "pupil" with "student."
<br><br>


***🚀 PHASE 3: Document Formatting**: Style Application. Typographical Adjustments.*
### 🟢 Status Ready.️ GPT-AHK-VBA REAL-TIME FORMATTER
Automates repetitive formatting tasks for real-time needs. Enables quick VBA macro development for style applications. Designed for ergonomic and rapid workflow.
### 🟢 Status Ready.️ VBA SCRIPTS FOR INDIVIDUAL FORMATTING TASKS
Multiple standalone VBA scripts are available for specific formatting tasks such as author name bolding in the bibliography, footnote adjustments, hyperlink text conversion, citation styling, and more. Ideal for targeted document formatting needs.
### 🟠 Status In Development. VBA DOCUMENT FORMATTING ASSISTANT
Working on unifying these ready-to-use scripts into a single, user-friendly interface. This integrated solution will streamline document formatting workflows for increased efficiency and convenience.
<br><br>


***🚀 PHASE 4: Word to XML DocBook Conversion (If applicable)**: Word-to-XML DocBook Transformations. Custom Tagging.*
### 🟢 Status Ready.️ VBA-JAVA-XSLT WORD STYLE TO TAG CONVERTER
Automates the conversion of Word documents with template-specific styles to XML documents with DocBook tags. Robust and efficient transformations.
### 🟢 Status Ready.️ XSLT-JAVA-DOCBOOK MULTI-FORMAT OUTPUT GENERATOR
