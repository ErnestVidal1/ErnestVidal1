## Professional Projects

In my journey as a software developer specialized in document design and automation, the projects I've undertaken can be grouped into several phases. Each phase corresponds to a crucial stage in the document editing and layout workflow. Here they are:

### PHASE 1: Template Design
- Original Template Creation in Word
- Cloning Template from a model PDF in Word
- Template Creation in XML (DocBook+XSLT)

### PHASE 2: Document Preparation
- Preparation and Cleanup
- Element Extraction (e.g., Images, Tables, Formulas, Code)
- Structure Verification
- Term Standardization

### PHASE 3: Document Formatting
- Style Application
- Typographical Adjustments

### PHASE 3: Document Formatting
- Style Application
- Typographical Adjustments


üõ†Ô∏è **GPT-Powered Real-Time VBA Formatting Accelerator:** Enhances real-time document formatting by dynamically automating repetitive tasks. Uses VBA, AutoHotkey (AHK), and GPT. Offers a unique, ergonomic, and rapid workflow tailored for real-time formatting needs. Status: Ready.


### PHASE 4: Word to XML Conversion (If applicable)


üõ†Ô∏è **VBA-XSLT Word Style to Tag Converter:** Automates the conversion of Word documents styled with custom tags to XML-based Word tags. Built on existing open-source project. Utilizes VBA and XSLT for robust and efficient transformations. Adds potential enhancements to the base project. Status: In Developm


### PHASE 5: Output Design and Format Review
- Review of PDF Converted from Word
- Review of Other Multi-format Outputs (e.g., HTML, EBOOK, Audiobook) (If using XML DocBook)

### PHASE 6: Incorporation of Author's Revisions
- Preparation of Amendments (e.g., Images, Text, including long fragments)
- Amendment Introduction (from PDF comments or location-based text doc)

### PHASE 7: Post-Conversion Adjustments
- Applicable in cases like PDF to Word conversion (e.g., for translations)

### PHASE 8: Miscellaneous (Logistics, Management)

This list is not exhaustive and serves as a snapshot of the software tools that are either complete or in stages of active development.
